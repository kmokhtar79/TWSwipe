    <string name="about_title">About 6thGear TWSwipe</string>
    <string name="about_message">"This application was developed by 6ThGear team to allow you to set custom action to the swipe feature of TW Launcher.
    \nAs a standalone app it will have no effect whatsoever on your built in launcher. It needs to be modded into the TW Launcher application by your rom developer.
    \nIf this app was included in the rom you're using, chances are your TW Launcher is modded accordingly and once you set a custom action, your launcher's swipe feature will display it.
    \nWe hope you enjoy our little contribution to the android development comunity
    \n6thGear Team: Wuby986 and Daxgirl"</string>
